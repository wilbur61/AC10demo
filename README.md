# Guided LAB - 309.7.1 -SP12 - Spring Data JPA, JPARepository, CRUD API Using Database (SQL)

Lab Objective:
In this lab, we will demonstrate how to make simple Spring Boot Hibernate APIs to manage a 
tutorial store application and store the details in an RDBMS using the Spring Data JPARepository 
interface (library) and SQL for an online tutorial application:
Each Tutorial has an id, title, description, and published status.
APIs help to create, retrieve, update, and delete tutorials.
APIs also support custom finder methods such as finding by published status or by title.
